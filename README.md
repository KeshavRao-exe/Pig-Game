# Pig-Game
This a game that i've built using HTML,CSS & Javascript.
Here are the rules:
The game starts with player one going first.
The player can roll the dice and the total will add up.
There's 2 options here; You could either hold the current total or try or luck and roll again.
If a one shows up on the dice, you loose the current score.
If you hold the score before a one turns up, it will be added to player one's total score.
Now it's player 2's turn and it's the same process over again.
The game end when either player reaches or crosses a total score of 100!
